General Dev Path:
 * Basic blank webpage running with Node.js, Express, Handlebar, and hooked up customer CSS and JS (DONE)
 * On the home page, show icon for a single cryptocurrency, with a hardcoded "current price"
 * Make the "current price" field update by getting data from a testing server via API get call
        * Build testing server (Task for Reed)
        * Make the API call happen via a button called "Get Prices" first
        * Then figure out how to make it run auto on some determined time scale
 * Display two cryptocurrency icon / price sections and hook up price data
 * Now may be the time for fixing any issues and thinking about how many cryptos will be displayed. Do any needed refactors.
 * Add a navigation bar to the top that will take the user to "All Current Prices", "Price History", and "Favorites" with no navigation. (done)
 * Hook up routing navigation for the navabar with Express:
   Leave "Price History" and "Favorites" pages blank other than a static title at first, just make the navigation work.
        * "All Current Prices" has already been built and will show all cryptos being tracked by the system with current price
        * "Price History" tab will require a database to store data over time via a small graph.
        * "Favorites" will need the database, and a way for a page user to select a crypto as a favorite, and then have it show up on the favorites page.
        No need for individual user logins yet.
 * Hook up MongoDB to the app and learn how to write data to a database table
 * Make a single crypto write data to a table whenever the API runs auto or via button push
 * Make a different crypto write price data to another database table
 * Make all cryptos have there own DB table and write price data
 * Hook up all this price data to a way of graphing that data in the "Price History" page.
 ** Find a way to identify if a string has a space.
